# Igotcha Technical Challenge

Please build an simple rails api based application that serves as back-end server for single page application.
The source code must be placed in a public repo on GitHub. The application should be deployable on Heroku.

* Model `User` should be created.
* There are two user types `Admin` & `User`.
* Build rest api interfaces for CRUD of user from single page application.
* Admin should be able to do anything for users (list, create, update, delete)
* User should only be able to get the information of himself.
* Login/Logout for both user types.
* Session management for Admin & User
* Cover with tests

* Bonus points if you can setup deployment environment.

We encourage you to use gems and libraries for everything. We are looking for a simple, clean, elegant design, tests and all round understanding of the full stack.
